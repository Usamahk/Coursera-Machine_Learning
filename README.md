## Repo containing scripts for practice and learning for the Machine Learning Course from Coursera

This repository holds scripts that were used in understanding both MatLAB and Octave as part of the Coursera Machine Learnin course given by Andrew Ng. I will try not to share any bits of the assignments but I will share functinos and workspace images, merely for my own personal needs so that I may access them to further my knowledge. 

All material belongs to Prof. Andrew Ng and the Coursera organization. I am excited to have these learning options available to me.
